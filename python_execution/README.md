# Docker python
This Docker image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and is intended to provide a RED (Curious Containers) Environment. The image sets up a non-interactive environment and installs various dependencies required for data processing and analysis tasks.
This Image provides an extra run.sh script, that should be executed when the container starts. With this script it is possible to run a Python script in a given (cc-input) directory.
